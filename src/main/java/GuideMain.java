/**
 * Welcome to your first lab! This lab will identify all the different entities that you'll be creating and

 *
 * This file is a CLASS. A CLASS is a blueprint for generating an OBJECT. For now, you can think of a
 * Class as its own program, whose functionality gets executed whenever one of its methods gets used. A method is
 * something that an Object can 'do'. Objects contain states (variables) and behavior (methods).

     * contain a main method, because we run our classes and methods within test cases instead. Main methods
     * always follow the same structure: public static void main(String[] args){}
     *
     * The main method will instantiate a new Guide object, produce a String using the Guide object's method
     * "guideMethod", and print to the Console what that String was.
     *
     * @param args when running a Java application from the command line, it could take arguments as additional
     *             information for running the app. We won't be using this.
